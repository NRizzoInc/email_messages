# Description

If you do not want to deal with starting and stopping the python virtual environment, look no further!

The two bash scripts within this directory are meant to help you run the python code while automatically

using the virtual environment so your global python system is not messed up

## Usage

* To run the email agent (the command line version of the web app): `<path to this dir>/email.sh`
* To run the web app: `<path to this dir>/web.sh`
* all command line flags used from the bash scripts will transfer over to the python scripts
